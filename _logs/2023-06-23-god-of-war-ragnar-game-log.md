### ðŸ”¥ [God of War RagnarÃ¶k](https://opencritic.com/game/12919/god-of-war-ragnar-k) / Masterpiece <small class="superscript">5/5</small>

> I highly recommend playing both games in a row for the full experience. Itâ€™s even more impactful if youâ€™re a parent, especially if you have a sonâ€”youâ€™ll deeply resonate with the emotions and journey of Kratos, as his story touches on themes of fatherhood, legacy, and personal growth. The connection becomes truly unforgettable!
