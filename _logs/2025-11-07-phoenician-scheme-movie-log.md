### [The Phoenician Scheme](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30840798) / Masterpice <small class="superscript">🔥</small>

> **The Phoenician Scheme** is a dazzling feast for the eyes — Wes Anderson’s signature symmetry, color, and wit come together in a film that’s equal parts absurd, elegant, and irresistibly stylish. Every frame feels like a painting in motion, making it impossible to look away even for a second.
