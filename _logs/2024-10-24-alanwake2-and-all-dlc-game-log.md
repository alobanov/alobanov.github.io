### [Alan Wake II](https://opencritic.com/game/15022/alan-wake-2) / Nice <small class="superscript">3/5</small>

> This game impressed me with its atmosphere and captivating lore. These elements truly stand out, creating a unique and immersive experience. However, the shooting mechanics felt average, and the repetitive level design with constant backtracking became frustrating. The ending of the main game was also a letdownâ€”open-ended conclusions just feel unsatisfying. On the bright side, the DLCs that came out later, especially **Lake House**, were excellent.
