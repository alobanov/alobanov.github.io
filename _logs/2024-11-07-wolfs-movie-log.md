### 🐺 [Wolfs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14257582) / It's OK <small class="superscript">3.5/5</small>

> Nothing special—a simple, predictable movie that feels like just one episode of a TV show. But even so, the charm and connection between the characters still show, which fans of Pitt and Clooney might enjoy.
