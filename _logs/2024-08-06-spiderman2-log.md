### [Spider-Man 2](https://opencritic.com/game/15052/marvels-spider-man-2) / Great <small class="superscript">4/5</small>

> Delivers with two Spideys—why settle for one? Smooth tag-team action, plus playing as Venom? Perfection! Fast, fun, and the web-slinging is better than ever. It’s a blockbuster! If you have a PS, just try it—it’s really good.
