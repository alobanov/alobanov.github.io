### 🐺 [Wolfs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14257582) / It's OK <small class="superscript">3.5/5</small>

> Nothing special—a standard, formulaic movie that feels like a single episode from a series. Despite this, the charisma and chemistry between the characters still shine through, which might appeal to fans of Pitt and Clooney.
