### [M:I - Dead Reckoning #1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/) / Sorry Mr. Cruise <small class="superscript">3/5</small>

> The **action scenes**<small class="superscript">👍</small> are amazing and really well done, but the **story**<small class="superscript">💩</small> is pretty bad. It feels more like a series now, and I watched it just to say I did. Plus, Hayley Atwell was completely miscast for that role.
