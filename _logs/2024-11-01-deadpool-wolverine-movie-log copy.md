### [Deadpool & Wolverine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/) / Grate <small class="superscript">4/5</small>

> The fan service is turned on to the maximum! It has everything — brightness, sharp irony, and uncompromising energy that grabs you from the first minute and holds you till the end. **Deadpool and Wolverine** have excellent chemistry and complement each other perfectly. The film is full of subtle references and jabs for those familiar with the Marvel universe. **I’d recommend this movie** to everyone — the critics shit themselves as always, but the film stands tall, and the audience proves it.
