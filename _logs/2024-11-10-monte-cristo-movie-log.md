### [The Count of Monte-Cristo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26446278/) / Meh <small class="superscript">2/5</small>

> Monte-Cristo changes a lot from the original book. It keeps the main idea of revenge, but loses some of the deeper meaning. Edmond is shown as almost a bad guy, driven only by anger and with no empathy, very different from the complex character in Dumas’ novel. Important parts of the story, like the ones with Valentine and Maximilian, are left out. This makes Edmond’s journey more about cold, hard revenge than about justice. If you haven’t read the book, you might enjoy the movie, but fans of the original story might find the changes too big.
