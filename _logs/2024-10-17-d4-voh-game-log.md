### [Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred](https://opencritic.com/game/17122/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred) / Grate <small class="superscript">4/5</small>

> This game series has been with me since childhood. The first part made a huge impression on me, but the second one was truly a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the third part was disappointing, but with the release of the fourth, I found my perfect match again. Its style and dark atmosphere fully capture the essence of the second game. I’m especially thrilled with the return to Kurast, in the new expansion — the city of eternal rain. It’s a return to the series’ roots, and I couldn’t ask for more!
