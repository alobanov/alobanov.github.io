### [Death Stranding 2: On the Beach](https://opencritic.com/game/18226/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach) / Grate <small class="superscript">4/5</small>

> Second **Death Stranding** is an atmospheric and unusual game that really impressed me with its visuals — the graphics are excellent. Even if you don’t plan to play, you should definitely watch how [Tommorow fights the mech-ghosts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXctji7Y3I4), how one of the [characters dances in the oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O91YcZWcUVY), and how the main villain and the main hero have a [guitar duel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SSe62ZOQNI) — it’s a spectacle worth seeing.
